# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-using-NN  
  
Recognition of the MNIST handwritten digits using a basic neural network model, with one hidden layer sandwiched by an input and an output layer.  
  
Network trained using cross entropy as the loss function and optimized with Adam. Comes with plots of the training and testing loss curves and mean accuracy with respect to the 40 training epochs. Refer to the .ipynb file for further information.
